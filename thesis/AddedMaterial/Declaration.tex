It is certified that the work presented in this thesis entitled ``{\textbf{Search for Quark Compositeness in $\mathbold{\gamma}+$jet final states in proton-proton
    collisions at $\mathbold{\sqrt{s}}$ $=$ 13 TeV with the CMS Detector at the Large Hadron Collider}'' has been carried out at the Department of Physics
  \nd Astrophysics, University of Delhi, Delhi, under the supervision of Prof. Brajesh Chandra Choudhary. This thesis deals with the search of excited states of light
  and heavy flavor quarks in the photon $+$ jet final states at a center-of-mass energy of 13\unit{TeV} using 35.9 \fbinv of proton$-$proton collision
data collected by the CMS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland.

This work has been done by the candidate herself and to the best of her knowledge, no part of this work has earlier been submitted for any degree or diploma
of this or any other university.
